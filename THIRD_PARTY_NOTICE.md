# Third Party Notice

This project is inspired by the following projects although we just don't copy and paste their code. We appreciate the authors of these projects.

Our work just provides you an option to use SPH method in Julia. If you are interested in SPH method, you can also check these projects.

- [TrixiParticles.jl](https://github.com/trixi-framework/TrixiParticles.jl): A part of `Trixi.jl` project.
- [SmoothedParticles.jl](https://github.com/OndrejKincl/SmoothedParticles.jl): Inspiration of this project.
- [SPHKernels.jl](https://github.com/LudwigBoess/SPHKernels.jl): Used for SPH kernel functions.
- [CellListMap.jl](https://github.com/LudwigBoess/SPHKernels.jl): Used for nearest neighbor search with the method of background grid.
- [NearestNeighbors.jl](https://juliapackages.com/p/nearestneighbors): Used for nearest neighbor search with the method of k-d tree or ball tree.
